# MQTT Topics — Authoritative Reference

## Purpose & Scope

This document is the authoritative registry of all `highland/` MQTT topics. It defines what exists, who owns it, whether it's retained, and what its payload looks like.

**Relationship to other docs:**
- **`standards/EVENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`** — philosophy, patterns, design rationale. Read that first.
- **`nodered/OVERVIEW.md`** — flow organization conventions, including how flows consume topics.
- **This document** — the reference. What topics actually exist, settled and locked.

---

## Namespace Summary

| Namespace | Purpose | Retained? |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `highland/event/` | Point-in-time facts. Something happened. | No |
| `highland/state/` | Current operational truth. What is true right now. | **Always** |
| `highland/status/` | Service health and liveness. Infra concerns only. | No (heartbeats); Yes (health snapshots) |
| `highland/command/` | Imperative instructions to a service. | No |
| `highland/ack/` | Acknowledgment infrastructure. | No |
| `highland/homeassistant/` | HA-facing projections. Consumer-shaped payloads that deviate from Highland conventions. | **Always** |

### `highland/homeassistant/` — Consumer-Shaped Projections

Some downstream consumers (specifically HA custom cards and integrations) require attribute payloads shaped to a specific external contract — PascalCase field names, specific key names, or other conventions that differ from Highland's snake_case standards. Rather than pollute canonical `highland/state/` topics with consumer-shaped data, those payloads are published to a parallel `highland/homeassistant/` topic.

**Rules:**
- Always retained — HA reads attributes on startup and must get current data immediately.
- Payloads may use PascalCase, mixed case, or any field naming required by the external consumer contract. This is intentional and not a bug.
- The corresponding `highland/state/` topic always exists and carries the canonical snake_case version of the same data.
- HA Discovery config points `json_attributes_topic` at the `highland/homeassistant/` topic, not `highland/state/`.
- No internal Highland flow should subscribe to `highland/homeassistant/` topics — use `highland/state/` instead.

**Current topics using this pattern:**

| `highland/homeassistant/` topic | Corresponding `highland/state/` topic | Consumer |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|
| `highland/homeassistant/weather/alerts` | `highland/state/weather/alerts` | `seevee/weather_alerts_card` (NwsAdapter) |

### Key Distinctions

**`highland/event/` vs `highland/state/`**

An event is something that *happened* — it fires and it's gone. Flows that miss it miss it. State is *what is currently true* — retained, always available, immediately meaningful to a restarting flow.

- Precipitation started → `event/` (it happened at a moment)
- Current synthesized weather conditions → `state/` (it's just true right now)
- Scheduler period transitioned to evening → `event/` (the transition happened)
- What period the house is currently in → `state/` (the house is in this period)

**`highland/state/` vs `highland/status/`**

State is operational — automations read it to make decisions. Status is infrastructure health — monitoring flows and dashboards read it. Don't put device sensor data under `status/`. Don't put heartbeats under `state/`.

---

## `highland/state/` Contract

This namespace is the primary integration surface between Node-RED and Home Assistant. Its rules are strict:

1. **Always retained** — that's the point. A restarting consumer gets current truth immediately.
2. **Always JSON** — structured objects, never raw scalars. HA uses `value_template` to extract fields.
3. **Single writer** — one flow owns each topic. No two flows publish to the same state topic.
4. **Source-neutral** — payload never indicates where the data came from. Consumers don't know or care whether a value originated from a physical sensor, a third-party API, or a calculated derivation.
5. **Atomic** — publish the full object on every update. Never partial patches.

### How Home Assistant Consumes `highland/state/`

Node-RED uses **MQTT Discovery** to register sensor entities with HA. HA auto-creates entities and tracks them — zero manual HA config required.

**Discovery topic pattern:**
```
homeassistant/{component}/{node_id}/{object_id}/config
```

- `{component}` — HA component type: `sensor`, `binary_sensor`, `switch`, etc.
- `{node_id}` — logical device grouping (groups related entities into one HA device)
- `{object_id}` — unique entity identifier within that device

**Example — outdoor temperature from weather conditions:**

Discovery config (published by Node-RED on startup, retained):
```
Topic: homeassistant/sensor/highland_weather/outdoor_temperature/config
```
```json
{
  "name": "Outdoor Temperature",
  "unique_id": "highland_weather_outdoor_temperature",
  "state_topic": "highland/state/weather/conditions",
  "value_template": "{{ value_json.temperature }}",
  "device_class": "temperature",
  "unit_of_measurement": "°F",
  "state_class": "measurement",
  "device": {
    "identifiers": ["highland_weather"],
    "name": "Highland Weather",
    "model": "Synthesized",
    "manufacturer": "Highland"
  }
}
```

State topic (the actual value, retained, updated on each synthesis cycle):
```
Topic: highland/state/weather/conditions
```
```json
{
  "temperature": 72.3,
  "humidity": 64,
  "wind_speed": 8.2,
  ...
}
```

HA creates a `sensor.outdoor_temperature` entity, watches `highland/state/weather/conditions`, and applies `value_template` to get `72.3`. When HA restarts, it re-reads the retained discovery config and retained state — it wakes up fully current.

**Key discovery config fields:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `device_class` | Semantic type (`temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure`, `wind_speed`, `precipitation`, `motion`, etc.) |
| `unit_of_measurement` | Scale (`°F`, `%`, `inHg`, `mph`, `in`, etc.) |
| `state_class` | History behavior: `measurement` (current value), `total_increasing` (accumulators like daily precip) |
| `value_template` | Jinja2 expression to extract scalar from JSON payload |

**Discovery is idempotent.** Publishing the same config repeatedly (e.g., on every Node-RED startup) is safe — HA ignores duplicate registrations with the same `unique_id`.

**Where discovery configs live:** The Config Loader flow publishes all discovery configs on startup. Sensor definitions live there as data — not scattered across flows.

---

## Standard Payload Envelope

All `highland/event/` and `highland/state/` payloads include:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T14:30:00Z",
  "source": "{flow_name}",
  ...domain-specific fields...
}
```

`highland/state/` payloads always include all fields (full object on every publish — no partial updates).

---

## Topic Registry

### Scheduler

**Purpose:** Defines the house's daily rhythm and fires time-based task triggers.

---

#### Period State

**`highland/state/scheduler/period`** ← RETAINED

Current period the house is in. Updated when period transitions.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Scheduler flow |
| **Consumers** | Any flow with time-of-day behavior |
| **Retained** | Yes |

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T17:35:00Z",
  "source": "scheduler",
  "period": "evening"
}
```

`period` values: `"day"` | `"evening"` | `"overnight"`

---

#### Period Transition Events

Point-in-time triggers — fire at the moment of transition. Not retained (use state topic to query current period).

**`highland/event/scheduler/day`**
**`highland/event/scheduler/evening`**
**`highland/event/scheduler/overnight`**

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Scheduler flow (schedex) |
| **Consumers** | Flows that need to react at the moment of transition |
| **Retained** | No |

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T17:35:00Z",
  "source": "scheduler"
}
```

---

#### Task Events

Bespoke point-in-time triggers for specific scheduled jobs.

**`highland/event/scheduler/midnight`**
Daily boundary trigger. Fires at 00:00:00. Both the Daily Digest flow and the LoRaWAN mailbox flow subscribe to this event.

**`highland/event/scheduler/backup_daily`**
Triggers the backup orchestration flow.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Scheduler flow |
| **Retained** | No |

All task events carry the minimal payload:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T00:00:00Z",
  "source": "scheduler"
}
```

---

### Weather

**Architecture:** Two separate Node-RED flows handle different aspects of weather data. Both are live and publishing.

- **`Utility: Weather Forecasts`** — NWS grid resolution (cronplus daily at 11:55 PM) + hourly forecast fetch from NWS forecast API.
- **`Utility: Weather Alerts`** — NWS active alerts endpoint, 30-second cronplus poll, alert lifecycle tracking.

Future Tier 2 flows (Tempest, Pirate Weather synthesis) will extend this namespace when implemented. The black-box synthesis architecture described in `subsystems/WEATHER_FLOW.md` is the target end state.

**Internal-only (never on the bus):**
- NWS raw API responses
- `flow.forecast_url` — grid-resolved forecast endpoint stored in flow context
- `flow.known_alerts` — alert lifecycle tracking map (disk-backed)

---

#### State Topics (Retained)

**`highland/state/weather/conditions`** ← RETAINED

Synthesized current conditions. Combines Tempest observations, model data, and derived calculations. Updated on each synthesis cycle.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Weather flow |
| **Consumers** | HA (via MQTT Discovery), any flow needing current conditions |
| **Retained** | Yes |

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T14:30:00Z",
  "source": "weather",
  "temperature": 72.3,
  "feels_like": 70.1,
  "humidity": 64,
  "dew_point": 58.2,
  "pressure": 29.92,
  "wind_speed": 8.2,
  "wind_gust": 14.1,
  "wind_bearing": 225,
  "uv_index": 4,
  "solar_radiation": 312,
  "visibility": 10.0,
  "cloud_cover": 0.35,
  "precipitation_active": false,
  "precipitation_type": "none",
  "precipitation_rate": 0.0,
  "lightning_last_strike_distance": null,
  "lightning_last_strike_at": null
}
```

*Field list is illustrative; finalize against Tempest API and Pirate Weather v2 field set during implementation. All `-999` sentinel values from Pirate Weather must be null-coerced before inclusion.*

---

**`highland/state/weather/forecast`** ← RETAINED

NWS forecast normalized to a date-keyed period map. Updated hourly by `Utility: Weather Forecasts`. Periods extend ~7 days.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Utility: Weather Forecasts |
| **Consumers** | Utility: Daily Digest |
| **Retained** | Yes |

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-26T14:00:00Z",
  "source": "nws",
  "forecast_url": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/OKX/26,71/forecast",
  "periods": {
    "2026-03-26": {
      "daytime": {
        "temperature": 54,
        "shortForecast": "Partly Sunny",
        "detailedForecast": "Partly sunny, with a high near 54.",
        "precipChance": 4,
        "windSpeed": "2 to 13 mph",
        "windDirection": "SW",
        "icon": "sct",
        "isDaytime": true
      },
      "overnight": {
        "temperature": 40,
        "shortForecast": "Mostly Cloudy",
        "detailedForecast": "Mostly cloudy, with a low around 40.",
        "precipChance": 14,
        "windSpeed": "6 to 10 mph",
        "windDirection": "S",
        "icon": "bkn",
        "isDaytime": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`icon` is the NWS condition code extracted from the NWS icon URL path (e.g. `sct`, `rain`, `tsra`, `snow`). Priority hierarchy resolves compound icon URLs — precipitation/severe codes take precedence over cloud cover codes. See `subsystems/WEATHER_FLOW.md` for the full NWS icon code reference and mapping table.

---

**`highland/state/weather/alerts`** ← RETAINED

Canonical active NWS weather alerts for the configured location. Updated every 30 seconds by `Utility: Weather Alerts`. `alerts` is an empty array and `count` is `0` when no alerts are active. This is the operational truth topic — internal consumers read from here.

Alerts are deduplicated before publishing via three-tier logic: (1) `messageType: Update` + `references` formal supersession, (2) VTEC key deduplication, (3) heuristic deduplication for non-VTEC products (same `event` + `senderName` + `areaDesc` with overlapping time windows). Alerts with `expires` in the past are pre-filtered regardless of NWS feed inclusion.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Utility: Weather Alerts |

      "correlation_id": "weather_alert_okx_wsw_w_0123"
    }
  ]
}
```

`severity` values (NWS): `Extreme` | `Severe` | `Moderate` | `Minor` | `Unknown`

> **HA-facing projection:** The `seevee/weather_alerts_card` NwsAdapter requires PascalCase field names and a capitalized `Alerts` key. This shaped payload is published to `highland/homeassistant/weather/alerts` — see that topic for details. HA Discovery for `sensor.weather_alerts` points `json_attributes_topic` at the `highland/homeassistant/` topic, not this one.

---

**`highland/homeassistant/weather/alerts`** ← RETAINED

HA-facing projection of `highland/state/weather/alerts`. Field names are PascalCase to satisfy the `NwsAdapter` contract in `seevee/weather_alerts_card`. Payload deviates from Highland snake_case conventions intentionally — see `highland/homeassistant/` namespace rules above.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Utility: Weather Alerts (same flow, same cycle) |

```

**HA Discovery:** `sensor.weather_alerts` under `Highland Weather Alerts` device. `value_template: "{{ value_json.count }}"`; `json_attributes_topic: highland/homeassistant/weather/alerts`. Card config: `provider: nws`.

---

**`highland/state/weather/precipitation`** ← RETAINED

Current precipitation event state. Distinct from conditions — this is the active event lifecycle, not point-in-time intensity readings.

| | |

```

`state` values: `"none"` | `"imminent"` | `"active"` | `"tapering"` | `"done"`

---

---

#### Weather Analysis

**`highland/state/weather/analysis`** ← RETAINED

Current precipitation threat analysis from `Utility: Weather Analysis`. Published every minute by CronPlus assembly cycle. Multi-source: OWM OneCall v3 provides minutely data (90-second acquisition), Open-Meteo provides hourly convective instability, Tempest provides `minutely[0]` ground truth. Single topic serves both operational consumers and HA sensor entity.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Utility: Weather Analysis |
| **Consumers** | Notification flows, dashboard consumers, HA (via MQTT Discovery) |
| **Retained** | Yes |

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-04-14T15:00:00Z",
  "has_threat": true,
  "onset_minutes": 14,
  "clear_minutes": 37,
  "is_intermittent": false,
  "extends_to_end": false,
  "all_types": ["rain"],
  "peak_intensity": 0.08,
  "cape": 480,
  "threat_type": "Rain",
  "message": "Rain starting in 14 minutes",
  "source": "owm",
  "minutely": [
    { "t": 1744545600, "i": 0.0, "p": 0.0, "k": "none" },
    { "t": 1744545660, "i": 0.0, "p": 0.12, "k": "none" }
  ]
}
```

`threat_type` — title-cased precipitation type when `has_threat` is true, `null` otherwise. HA entity state; changes only when threat type changes (cleaner history than `message`). Values: `Rain` | `Snow` | `Sleet` | `Rain and Snow` | `Rain and Sleet` | `Snow and Sleet` | `Rain, Snow, and Sleet` | `Heavy Rain` | `Heavy Snow` | `Thunderstorms` | `Thundersnow` | `null`.

`message` — human-readable AccuWeather-style summary string, or `null` when no threat. HA entity attribute.

`cape` — current-hour CAPE from Open-Meteo convective section (J/kg).

`minutely` — compact 60-entry array of per-minute forecast data. Fields: `t` (Unix timestamp), `i` (precip intensity in/hr), `p` (precip probability 0–1), `k` (precip type string). `minutely[0]` is always Tempest ground truth.

**HA Discovery:** `sensor.weather_analysis` under `Highland Weather Analysis` device. `value_template: "{{ value_json.threat_type if value_json.threat_type else 'Clear' }}"`; `json_attributes_topic` same as `state_topic`.

---

---

#### Lightning

**`highland/state/weather/lightning`** ← RETAINED

Current lightning threat state. Published by `Utility: Weather Lightning` on every incoming strike event from the Tempest hardware sensor. Updated regardless of whether a notification was fired.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Utility: Weather Lightning |
| **Consumers** | HA (via MQTT Discovery), automation flows, dashboard consumers |
| **Retained** | Yes |

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-04-13T12:00:00Z",
  "source": "weather_lightning",
  "state": "nearby",
  "last_strike_distance": 2.4,
  "last_strike_at": "2026-04-13T12:00:00Z",
  "last_notified_distance": 2.4,
  "last_notified_at": "2026-04-13T12:00:00Z"
}
```

`state` values: `"none"` | `"distant"` | `"nearby"`

`state` is derived from `last_strike_distance` relative to the `nearby_miles` threshold (default 5 miles from `thresholds.json`). `"none"` when no strikes observed in the current session.

`last_notified_distance` and `last_notified_at` — the strike that last triggered a notification, which may differ from `last_strike_distance` when a notification was suppressed by cooldown logic.

**HA Discovery:** `sensor.weather_lightning` under `Highland Weather Lightning` device. `value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"`; `json_attributes_topic` same as `state_topic`.

---

---

#### Radar Topics

**`highland/status/weather/radar/{product}`** ← RETAINED

### Weather Station

**Architecture:** WeatherFlow Tempest station broadcasting UDP on port 50222 (LAN). A `socat` relay on the Workflow host (systemd: `highland-tempest-relay`) forwards to port 50223 where Node-RED's Docker container can receive it. `Utility: Weather Station` decodes and normalizes all Tempest message types.

**Message types handled:**
- `obs_st` — full observation every 1 minute → state + observation event
- `evt_precip` — optical rain sensor trigger → precipitation start event
- `evt_strike` — lightning detection → lightning event
- `rapid_wind` — wind every 3 seconds → plumbing in place, not yet processed

---

#### State Topics (Retained)

**`highland/state/weather/station`** ← RETAINED

Normalized Tempest observation. Published once per minute on every `obs_st` message. All values converted to US customary units.

#### Infrastructure

**socat relay** (`highland-tempest-relay.service` on Workflow host)

Receives Tempest UDP broadcast on port 50222 and unicasts to `127.0.0.1:50223`. Required because Docker bridge networking does not forward broadcast traffic to containers.

```
socat UDP-RECV:50222,reuseaddr UDP-SENDTO:127.0.0.1:50223
```

Node-RED docker-compose maps `50223/udp` into the container. The `Utility: Weather Station` UDP In node listens on port 50223.

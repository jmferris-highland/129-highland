# Highland Home Automation — Documentation Index

## What This Is

Ground-up rebuild of an existing Home Assistant infrastructure. The goal is a distributed, resilient system where protocol coordinators and automations survive Home Assistant restarts — eliminating single points of failure.

**Core philosophy:** Node-RED is the automation engine. Home Assistant is the consumer and dashboard layer. Critical automations survive HA outages. HA recovers fully on restart via MQTT Discovery — no manual intervention required.

**Current phase:** Documentation complete, hardware in-hand — ready to build.

## Quick Reference: Key Decisions

These have been discussed and decided. Reference the relevant doc for rationale.

| Decision | Where to find it |
|----------|-----------------|
| Four-box architecture (HAOS, Hub, Workflow, Edge AI) | `architecture/OVERVIEW.md` |
| MQTT as control plane | `standards/EVENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Node-RED owns automations; HA is consumer only | `architecture/OVERVIEW.md` |
| MQTT-triggered backups, each host owns its backup | `architecture/BACKUP_RECOVERY.md` |
| File-based config, `secrets.json` gitignored | `nodered/CONFIG_MANAGEMENT.md` |
| Schedex for time triggers | `nodered/SCHEDULING.md` |
| JSONL logging, 30-day retention | `nodered/LOGGING.md` |
| HA Companion App as primary notification channel | `nodered/NOTIFICATIONS.md` |
| Google Calendar for scheduled events | `subsystems/CALENDAR_INTEGRATION.md` |
| Attendee-based camera suppression | `subsystems/CALENDAR_INTEGRATION.md` |
| Healthchecks.io for external monitoring | `nodered/HEALTH_MONITORING.md` |
| PostgreSQL on Workflow host (shared: HA Recorder + video pipeline) | `RUNBOOK.md` §3.13 |
| Pirate Weather API v2 over Weatherbit | `subsystems/WEATHER_FLOW.md` |

## Documentation Map

### Architecture

System-level decisions, hardware, topology, network, and backup strategy.

## Protocols

### Privacy & Security

This repository is public. When creating or updating documents, always redact:
- GPS coordinates — use `secrets.json` references
- Domain names — use `your-domain.example` as placeholder
- Email addresses — use generic descriptions or `secrets.json` references
- Internal hostnames/IPs — use `.local` mDNS names or `192.168.x.x`
- API keys, tokens, passwords — always use placeholders

When in doubt: *"Could someone use this to locate or access the system?"* If yes, redact it.

### Capturing Ideas

New automation ideas → `AUTOMATION_BACKLOG.md`. Don't derail current work; capture and move on.

### Working Style

- Peer-level, informal — well-acquainted colleagues
- Pragmatic over perfect
- Separation of concerns is a core value
- Intentional design choices over convenience
- "Zero-baggage" migration — rebuild from scratch, don't copy legacy

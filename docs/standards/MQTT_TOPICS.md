# MQTT Topics — Authoritative Reference

## Purpose & Scope

This document is the authoritative registry of all `highland/` MQTT topics. It defines what exists, who owns it, whether it's retained, and what its payload looks like.

**Relationship to other docs:**
- **`standards/EVENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`** — philosophy, patterns, design rationale. Read that first.
- **`nodered/OVERVIEW.md`** — flow organization conventions, including how flows consume topics.
- **This document** — the reference. What topics actually exist, settled and locked.

---

## Namespace Summary

| Namespace | Purpose | Retained? |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `highland/event/` | Point-in-time facts. Something happened. | No |
| `highland/state/` | Current operational truth. What is true right now. | **Always** |
| `highland/status/` | Service health and liveness. Infra concerns only. | No (heartbeats); Yes (health snapshots) |
| `highland/command/` | Imperative instructions to a service. | No |
| `highland/ack/` | Acknowledgment infrastructure. | No |

### Key Distinctions

**`highland/event/` vs `highland/state/`**

An event is something that *happened* — it fires and it's gone. Flows that miss it miss it. State is *what is currently true* — retained, always available, immediately meaningful to a restarting flow.

- Precipitation started → `event/` (it happened at a moment)
- Current synthesized weather conditions → `state/` (it's just true right now)
- Scheduler period transitioned to evening → `event/` (the transition happened)
- What period the house is currently in → `state/` (the house is in this period)

**`highland/state/` vs `highland/status/`**

State is operational — automations read it to make decisions. Status is infrastructure health — monitoring flows and dashboards read it. Don't put device sensor data under `status/`. Don't put heartbeats under `state/`.

---

## `highland/state/` Contract

This namespace is the primary integration surface between Node-RED and Home Assistant. Its rules are strict:

1. **Always retained** — that's the point. A restarting consumer gets current truth immediately.
2. **Always JSON** — structured objects, never raw scalars. HA uses `value_template` to extract fields.
3. **Single writer** — one flow owns each topic. No two flows publish to the same state topic.
4. **Source-neutral** — payload never indicates where the data came from. Consumers don't know or care whether a value originated from a physical sensor, a third-party API, or a calculated derivation.
5. **Atomic** — publish the full object on every update. Never partial patches.

### How Home Assistant Consumes `highland/state/`

Node-RED uses **MQTT Discovery** to register sensor entities with HA. HA auto-creates entities and tracks them — zero manual HA config required.

**Discovery topic pattern:**
```
homeassistant/{component}/{node_id}/{object_id}/config
```

- `{component}` — HA component type: `sensor`, `binary_sensor`, `switch`, etc.
- `{node_id}` — logical device grouping (groups related entities into one HA device)
- `{object_id}` — unique entity identifier within that device

**Example — outdoor temperature from weather conditions:**

Discovery config (published by Node-RED on startup, retained):
```
Topic: homeassistant/sensor/highland_weather/outdoor_temperature/config
```
```json
{
  "name": "Outdoor Temperature",
  "unique_id": "highland_weather_outdoor_temperature",
  "state_topic": "highland/state/weather/conditions",
  "value_template": "{{ value_json.temperature }}",
  "device_class": "temperature",
  "unit_of_measurement": "°F",
  "state_class": "measurement",
  "device": {
    "identifiers": ["highland_weather"],
    "name": "Highland Weather",
    "model": "Synthesized",
    "manufacturer": "Highland"
  }
}
```

State topic (the actual value, retained, updated on each synthesis cycle):
```
Topic: highland/state/weather/conditions
```
```json
{
  "temperature": 72.3,
  "humidity": 64,
  "wind_speed": 8.2,
  ...
}
```

HA creates a `sensor.outdoor_temperature` entity, watches `highland/state/weather/conditions`, and applies `value_template` to get `72.3`. When HA restarts, it re-reads the retained discovery config and retained state — it wakes up fully current.

**Key discovery config fields:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `device_class` | Semantic type (`temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure`, `wind_speed`, `precipitation`, `motion`, etc.) |
| `unit_of_measurement` | Scale (`°F`, `%`, `inHg`, `mph`, `in`, etc.) |
| `state_class` | History behavior: `measurement` (current value), `total_increasing` (accumulators like daily precip) |
| `value_template` | Jinja2 expression to extract scalar from JSON payload |

**Discovery is idempotent.** Publishing the same config repeatedly (e.g., on every Node-RED startup) is safe — HA ignores duplicate registrations with the same `unique_id`.

**Where discovery configs live:** The Config Loader flow publishes all discovery configs on startup. Sensor definitions live there as data — not scattered across flows.

---

## Standard Payload Envelope

All `highland/event/` and `highland/state/` payloads include:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T14:30:00Z",
  "source": "{flow_name}",
  ...domain-specific fields...
}
```

`highland/state/` payloads always include all fields (full object on every publish — no partial updates).

---

## Topic Registry

### Scheduler

**Purpose:** Defines the house's daily rhythm and fires time-based task triggers.

---

#### Period State

**`highland/state/scheduler/period`** ← RETAINED

Current period the house is in. Updated when period transitions.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Scheduler flow |
| **Consumers** | Any flow with time-of-day behavior |
| **Retained** | Yes |

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T17:35:00Z",
  "source": "scheduler",
  "period": "evening"
}
```

`period` values: `"day"` | `"evening"` | `"overnight"`

---

#### Period Transition Events

Point-in-time triggers — fire at the moment of transition. Not retained (use state topic to query current period).

**`highland/event/scheduler/day`**
**`highland/event/scheduler/evening`**
**`highland/event/scheduler/overnight`**

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Scheduler flow (schedex) |
| **Consumers** | Flows that need to react at the moment of transition |
| **Retained** | No |

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T17:35:00Z",
  "source": "scheduler"
}
```

---

#### Task Events

Bespoke point-in-time triggers for specific scheduled jobs.

**`highland/event/scheduler/midnight`**
Daily boundary trigger. Fires at 00:00:00. Both the Daily Digest flow and the LoRaWAN mailbox flow subscribe to this event.

**`highland/event/scheduler/backup_daily`**
Triggers the backup orchestration flow.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Scheduler flow |
| **Retained** | No |

All task events carry the minimal payload:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T00:00:00Z",
  "source": "scheduler"
}
```

---

### Weather

**Architecture:** Two separate Node-RED flows handle different aspects of weather data. Both are live and publishing.

- **`Utility: Weather Forecasts`** — NWS grid resolution (cronplus daily at 11:55 PM) + hourly forecast fetch from NWS forecast API.
- **`Utility: Weather Alerts`** — NWS active alerts endpoint, 30-second cronplus poll, alert lifecycle tracking.

Future Tier 2 flows (Tempest, Pirate Weather synthesis) will extend this namespace when implemented. The black-box synthesis architecture described in `subsystems/WEATHER_FLOW.md` is the target end state.

**Internal-only (never on the bus):**
- NWS raw API responses
- `flow.forecast_url` — grid-resolved forecast endpoint stored in flow context
- `flow.known_alerts` — alert lifecycle tracking map (disk-backed)

---

#### State Topics (Retained)

**`highland/state/weather/conditions`** ← RETAINED

Synthesized current conditions. Combines Tempest observations, model data, and derived calculations. Updated on each synthesis cycle.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Weather flow |
| **Consumers** | HA (via MQTT Discovery), any flow needing current conditions |
| **Retained** | Yes |

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-09T14:30:00Z",
  "source": "weather",
  "temperature": 72.3,
  "feels_like": 70.1,
  "humidity": 64,
  "dew_point": 58.2,
  "pressure": 29.92,
  "wind_speed": 8.2,
  "wind_gust": 14.1,
  "wind_bearing": 225,
  "uv_index": 4,
  "solar_radiation": 312,
  "visibility": 10.0,
  "cloud_cover": 0.35,
  "precipitation_active": false,
  "precipitation_type": "none",
  "precipitation_rate": 0.0,
  "lightning_last_strike_distance": null,
  "lightning_last_strike_at": null
}
```

*Field list is illustrative; finalize against Tempest API and Pirate Weather v2 field set during implementation. All `-999` sentinel values from Pirate Weather must be null-coerced before inclusion.*

---

**`highland/state/weather/forecast`** ← RETAINED

NWS forecast normalized to a date-keyed period map. Updated hourly by `Utility: Weather Forecasts`. Periods extend ~7 days.

| | |
|--|--|
| **Publisher** | Utility: Weather Forecasts |
| **Consumers** | Utility: Daily Digest |
| **Retained** | Yes |

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-26T14:00:00Z",
  "source": "nws",
  "forecast_url": "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/OKX/26,71/forecast",
  "periods": {
    "2026-03-26": {
      "daytime": {
        "temperature": 54,
        "shortForecast": "Partly Sunny",
        "detailedForecast": "Partly sunny, with a high near 54.",
        "precipChance": 4,
        "windSpeed": "2 to 13 mph",
        "windDirection": "SW",
        "icon": "sct",
        "isDaytime": true
      },
      "overnight": {
        "temperature": 40,
        "shortForecast": "Mostly Cloudy",
        "detailedForecast": "Mostly cloudy, with a low around 40.",
        "precipChance": 14,
        "windSpeed": "6 to 10 mph",
        "windDirection": "S",
        "icon": "bkn",
        "isDaytime": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`icon` is the NWS condition code extracted from the NWS icon URL path (e.g. `sct`, `rain`, `tsra`, `snow`). Priority hierarchy resolves compound icon URLs — precipitation/severe codes take precedence over cloud cover codes. See `subsystems/WEATHER_FLOW.md` for the full NWS icon code reference and mapping table.

---

**`highland/state/weather/alerts`** ← RETAINED

**`highland/event/driveway/{bin}/returned`** — Bin transitions from `PICKED_UP` or `AWAY` back to `HOME`.

`{bin}` values: `trash_bin` | `recycling_bin`

---

### Mailbox

**Architecture:** LoRaWAN door/contact sensor (Milesight EM300-MCS) combined with USPS Informed Delivery email parsing. Neither signal alone is sufficient. See `subsystems/LORA.md`.

  "loaded": ["device_registry", "notifications", "thresholds", "secrets"],
  "errors": [],
  "scope": "all",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

**`highland/status/mqtt/probe`** — Non-retained round-trip probe for MQTT edge health check. Empty payload.

**`highland/status/{service}/heartbeat`** — Simple liveness ping, not retained.

**`highland/status/{service}/health`** ← RETAINED — Detailed health snapshot. `status` values: `"healthy"` | `"degraded"` | `"unhealthy"`

| **Presence / Occupancy** | FP300 sensors; `highland/state/{area}/occupancy` likely pattern |
| **Video Pipeline** | Kill switch, detection events, triage results |
| **HA Assist / Voice** | Marvin persona events; may not need bus presence |
| **Area sensors** | Zigbee environmental, motion, contact |
| **Lighting state** | TBD if lighting state needs bus representation beyond Z2M raw topics |
| **Entry Door Locks** | Z-Wave/Zigbee door locks; state beyond what Z2M/ZWaveJS already exposes |

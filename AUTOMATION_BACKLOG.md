# Automation Backlog

Captured ideas for future automations. Not requirements — just things worth exploring when time permits.

## How to Use This Document

**Adding ideas:**
- Capture the concept, not the implementation
- Note what triggered the idea (pain point, inspiration, etc.)
- Don't over-think it — a sentence or two is fine

**Promoting to implementation:**
- Move to "In Progress" when actively working on it
- Remove from backlog when complete (or abandoned)

| Host metrics monitoring | CPU load, memory usage, disk usage, and operating temperatures for Hub and Workflow hosts. Lightweight agent script per host publishes to `highland/status/{host}/metrics` (retained); Health Monitor evaluates against thresholds from `thresholds.json`. Hub will also need per-container metrics via `docker stats`. Revisit when baseline is stable and there is a concrete reason to care. | 2026-03-23 |

## Infrastructure Projects

Major efforts that enable new capabilities across the system.

### Video Analysis Pipeline & Database Infrastructure

**Priority:** Future (Post-Phase 1)  
**Complexity:** High  
**Added:** 2026-03-02

#### Overview

Replace LLM Vision integration with a fully Node-RED-owned video analysis pipeline. Eliminates third-party integration dependency while maintaining Assist queryability via calendar-based event storage. Requires PostgreSQL for concurrent write support.

#### Components

**PostgreSQL Infrastructure**
- Deploy PostgreSQL container on Node-RED/Utility box
- Configure HA Recorder to use external PostgreSQL
- Validate concurrent write capability (HA + Node-RED)
- Establish backup/retention strategy

**Video Analysis Flow (Node-RED)**
- Camera motion event trigger
- Keyframe/clip capture
- Gemini triage (worth deep analysis?)
- Gemini deep analysis (full scene description)
- Media storage to HA `/media/analysis/...`
- Calendar event creation via `calendar.create_event`

**Calendar Event Schema**
```
Title: "{category} - {camera_friendly_name}"
Description:
  camera: {entity_id}
  category: {delivery|person|vehicle|animal|unknown}
  confidence: {0.0-1.0}
  objects: {comma-separated list}
  summary: {narrative description}
  keyframe: {/media/analysis/.../file.jpg}
  clip: {/media/analysis/.../file.mp4}
```

**Assist Integration**
- Create Local Calendar entity: `calendar.video_analysis_timeline`
- Create query script with descriptive `description` field for LLM tool discovery
- Script pulls events via `calendar.get_events`, returns formatted data
- Test with Assist: "Was my package delivered?"

**Retention Management**
- Define retention periods (events: permanent?, media: 30/90 days?)
- Node-RED flow for media cleanup (cron-style)
- Handle orphaned references gracefully

#### Open Questions
- Optimal calendar event structure for LLM parsing (plain text vs structured)
- Multi-camera correlation (same event seen by multiple cameras)
- Event deduplication strategy

# Appliance Monitoring — Cycle Detection

## Purpose & Scope

Power-based cycle detection for the three ZEN15-monitored appliances: washing machine, dryer, and dishwasher. Reliable start/end detection that works correctly for each appliance's unique power signature — without false-starts, premature termination, or missing actual completion.

Node-RED owns all cycle state. HA receives entities via MQTT Discovery and can display state, trigger notifications, and expose Assist commands — but it is a consumer, not the source of truth.

**Inspired by:** [ha_washdata](https://github.com/3dg1luk43/ha_washdata) — this design extracts the essential logic (state machine + energy gate) and reimplements it natively in Node-RED.

## Why Simple Thresholds Fail

Each appliance has a specific failure mode that ruins naive "power below X for Y seconds" logic:

**Washing machine** — Rinse cycles drop power to near-zero before spinning hard again. A 3-minute off-delay fires right in the middle of a rinse-spin sequence.

**Dryer** — The heating element is thermostat-controlled and cycles on/off throughout the entire run. Near the end, there's a cool-down phase: element off, drum motor still running (~200–300W). You're stuck choosing between "fires too early on every cool-down" or "waits several minutes past actual completion."

**Dishwasher** — Has genuine zero-power gaps between wash/rinse/heated-dry phases. Initial design assumed air-dry was the hard problem (20+ minutes of zero watts at the end). First real cycle trace revealed a better approach — see **Observed Power Signatures** below.

**The solution:** Instead of asking "is power below threshold?", ask "has effectively zero *energy* flowed in the last N seconds?" Combined with per-appliance off-delays calibrated to each device's behavior, this collapses all three failure modes. For the dishwasher specifically, the energy gate approach is supplemented by positive confirmation of the end-of-cycle alarm signal.

## Data Pipeline

```
ZEN15 (Z-Wave) → Z-Wave JS UI → MQTT → Node-RED
                                         ↓
                                  State Machine
                                         ↓
                              MQTT Topics (state + events)
                                         ↓
                              HA via MQTT Discovery
                              PostgreSQL (cycle records)
```

### Z-Wave JS UI MQTT Topics

**Action required at bring-up:** Subscribe to `zwave/{node_name}/#` for each appliance node and observe what topics Z-Wave JS UI publishes. The power value (Watts) is the one we care about. Confirm unit is Watts (ZEN15 reports in W, not kW). Update config with confirmed topic paths.

**Polling vs. push:** Configure ZEN15 in Z-Wave JS UI for report-on-change with a threshold (2–5W recommended) plus a periodic fallback (60s). Prefer report-on-change for responsive detection.

```

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `off` | No cycle in progress |
| `starting` | Power above threshold; accumulating energy to confirm real start |
| `running` | Cycle confirmed and actively running |
| `between_phases` | *(Dishwasher only)* Power dropped during cycle; waiting for resumption or transition to expecting_completion |
| `expecting_completion` | *(Dishwasher only)* Heated dry ended; waiting for end-of-cycle alarm spike |
| `ending` | Power low long enough to start considering cycle complete; energy gate applied |
| `finished` | Cycle completed normally; auto-expires to `off` after 30 minutes |
| `interrupted` | Cycle ended too short to be a valid run |
| `force_stopped` | Watchdog forced termination (sensor went silent) |

### Dynamic Pause/End Thresholds

The pause threshold is calibrated to the sensor's actual update cadence:

```
pause_delay_s = max(configured_min, 3 × p95_update_interval)
end_candidate_delay_s = max(pause_delay_s + 15s, configured_min_end)
```

`p95_update_interval` is tracked as a rolling statistic from the last 20 received readings. If the ZEN15 reports every 30s, the pause threshold auto-adjusts to ~90s minimum.

## Per-Appliance Configuration

### Washing Machine

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| `start_threshold_w` | 2.0 W | Any real motor draw |
| `stop_threshold_w` | 2.0 W | Symmetric hysteresis |
| `start_duration_s` | 5 s | Debounce |
| `start_energy_wh` | 0.2 Wh | |
| `pause_delay_s` | 90 s (min) | Rinse gap tolerance |
| `end_candidate_delay_s` | 180 s (min) | |
| `off_delay_s` | 300 s | 5 min after energy gate passes |
| `end_energy_wh_gate` | 0.05 Wh | Effectively zero |
| `min_off_gap_s` | 480 s | 8 min — soak cycle handling |
| `completion_min_s` | 600 s | 10 min to be a valid cycle |

### Dryer

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| `start_threshold_w` | 5.0 W | Element draws hard |
| `stop_threshold_w` | 3.0 W | Cool-down still has motor |
| `start_energy_wh` | 0.5 Wh | Element kicks in immediately |
| `pause_delay_s` | 60 s (min) | Thermostat cycling is fast |
| `off_delay_s` | 300 s | 5 min — cool-down phase |

**Note:** `stop_threshold_w` is set above zero because the drum motor runs throughout cool-down. The energy gate is what actually confirms the cycle is done.

### Dishwasher

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| `start_threshold_w` | 2.0 W | Above 1W idle baseline |
| `idle_baseline_w` | 1.0 W | Observed standby draw — board alive, no active cycle |
| `pause_delay_s` | 300 s (min) | Phase gaps can be long |
| `end_candidate_delay_s` | 600 s (min) | Heated dry phase gap tolerance |
| `expecting_completion_delay_s` | 300 s | 5 min below 5W to enter EXPECTING_COMPLETION |
| `expecting_completion_threshold_w` | 5.0 W | Upper bound of idle/standby; heating cycles are 400W+ |
| `alarm_signal_min_w` | 8.0 W | Minimum power for alarm spike (observed ~21W; conservative lower bound) |
| `alarm_signal_max_w` | 50.0 W | Upper bound — if power exceeds this, it's another heat cycle not the alarm |
| `off_delay_s` | 1800 s | Fallback only — if alarm signal never detected, fall back to 30-min energy gate |
| `post_cycle_tail_s` | 1200 s | Observed ~20 min 1W draw after mechanical completion; informational only |
| `completion_min_s` | 900 s | 15 min minimum to be a valid cycle |

**Note:** The `expecting_completion` state replaces the crude 30-minute `off_delay_s` approach as the primary completion detection path. The alarm signal provides positive confirmation rather than waiting for absence of activity. The `off_delay_s` fallback remains for edge cases where the alarm signal is missed or absent (e.g. some programs, manual cancellation). All threshold values are based on a single observed cycle and should be validated across multiple cycles and programs before hardening.

## Energy Gate Logic

Trapezoidal integration in a Function node:

```javascript
function integrateWh(samples) {
    if (samples.length < 2) return 0;
    let wh = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < samples.length; i++) {
        const dt_hours = (samples[i].t - samples[i-1].t) / 3_600_000;
        const avg_p = (samples[i].p + samples[i-1].p) / 2;
        wh += avg_p * dt_hours;
    }
    return wh;
}
```

At the ENDING transition check, compute energy over the window covering the last `off_delay_s` seconds. If ≤ `end_energy_wh_gate`, the cycle is done. If it exceeds the gate (real power drew in that window), hold in ENDING.

## Observed Power Signatures

### Dishwasher (2026-04-04, full cycle)

Observed on a single full cycle run. All thresholds derived from this trace are provisional pending validation across multiple cycles and programs.

**Baseline:**
- `0W` — true off; dishwasher fully idle between cycles
- `1W` — control board standby; present at cycle startup and for ~20 minutes after mechanical completion

**Cycle timeline:**

| Time | Event | Power |
|------|-------|-------|
| 12:54:57 | Cycle start — 0W → 1W → 15W | 0 → 1 → 15W |
| ~12:55–1:30 | Main wash phase (heating elements + pump) | ~800–1000W |
| ~1:30–1:45 | Zero-power gap between wash phases | ~0–1W |
| ~1:45–2:00 | Second wash phase | ~750–850W |
| ~2:00–2:15 | Transition / drain | low |
| ~2:15–2:56 | Heated dry — thermostat-cycling element | ~400–500W oscillating |
| 2:56:18 | Last heat cycle ends | drops to ~1W |
| ~2:56–3:08 | Post-heat lull — 12 minute window | ~1W |
| 3:08:13 | End-of-cycle alarm spike begins | 1W → ~21W |
| 3:08:53 | Alarm ends — mechanical cycle complete (audible signal) | → 1W |
| 3:08:53–3:28:57 | Post-cycle control board tail | 1W |
| 3:28:57 | True idle — board powers down | → 0W |

**Key observations:**
- Inter-heat-cycle gap during heated dry: ~2 minutes. Five minutes of sustained low power reliably indicates heated dry has ended.
- Alarm signal: ~21W, duration ~40 seconds. Well above 1W idle, well below 400W+ heating. Clean discrimination window (8–50W).
- Post-cycle 1W tail: almost exactly 20 minutes. Not a phase gap — true idle period before full shutdown.
- Total cycle duration: ~2h14m (start threshold to alarm signal).

**EXPECTING_COMPLETION transition logic:**
- Enter from `between_phases` when: elapsed in `between_phases` ≥ `expecting_completion_delay_s` (5 min)
- Exit to `finished` when: power rises above `alarm_signal_min_w` (8W) AND below `alarm_signal_max_w` (50W) — that's the alarm
- Exit back to `running` when: power rises above `alarm_signal_max_w` (50W) — another heat cycle, not the alarm
- Fallback: if neither condition fires within `off_delay_s` (30 min), fall through to standard energy gate → `ending`

## HA Entities via MQTT Discovery

Per appliance — using `washing_machine` as example:

| Entity | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Cycle State | `sensor` | `off`/`starting`/`running`/`paused`/`ending`/`finished`/`interrupted` |
| Cycle Duration | `sensor` | Unit: `s`, device_class: `duration` |
| Cycle Energy | `sensor` | Unit: `Wh`, device_class: `energy` |
| Current Power | `sensor` | Unit: `W`, device_class: `power` |
| Cycle Active | `binary_sensor` | `on` when state not in terminal states |

**Binary sensor value_template:**
```
{{ value_json.state not in ['off', 'finished', 'interrupted', 'force_stopped'] }}
```

## PostgreSQL Schema

Cycle records written on cycle completion:

```sql
CREATE TABLE appliance_cycles (
    id              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    cycle_id        TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    appliance       TEXT NOT NULL,
    started_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    ended_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    duration_s      INTEGER NOT NULL,
    energy_wh       NUMERIC(8,3) NOT NULL,
    max_power_w     NUMERIC(8,2) NOT NULL,
    status          TEXT NOT NULL,
    termination_reason TEXT,
    matched_profile TEXT,
    match_confidence NUMERIC(4,3),
    power_trace     JSONB,
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

`power_trace` stores raw power samples for Phase 2 profile learning. Initially nullable — enable when Phase 2 is implemented.

---

## Watchdog

If the ZEN15 stops reporting (sensor offline, Z-Wave JS UI restart), a watchdog catches the stuck state:

- If state is `running` or `paused` and no reading has arrived in `no_update_timeout_s` (default: 600s), force-transition to `force_stopped`
- Notification fired; termination reason: `"watchdog"`

Implementation: inject node set to `no_update_timeout_s`, reset on every received reading.

---

## Phase 2 — Profile Matching (Backlog)

Once the core state machine is proven stable across several weeks, Phase 2 adds smart termination by matching power traces against known cycle profiles via DTW (Dynamic Time Warping). Enables estimated time remaining and earlier cycle completion detection without waiting for full off-delay.

See `AUTOMATION_BACKLOG.md` for status.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Dishwasher alarm signal validation — observed ~21W on one cycle. Confirm amplitude and duration are consistent across different programs (quick wash, heavy duty, eco). Adjust `alarm_signal_min_w` / `alarm_signal_max_w` if needed.
- [ ] Dishwasher BETWEEN_PHASES / EXPECTING_COMPLETION thresholds — 5W threshold and 5-minute delay derived from single trace. Validate that inter-heat-cycle gaps during normal heated dry operation never exceed 5 minutes.
- [ ] ZEN15 MQTT topic paths — exact paths from Z-Wave JS UI to be confirmed at bring-up. Update `config.zwave_topic` per appliance once verified.
- [ ] ZEN15 report parameters — configure per-node: 5W threshold, 10s min interval, 60s periodic (initial recommendation; tune per appliance).
- [ ] Power trace storage — decide whether to store from day one or enable later. ~2KB per cycle at 30s intervals for 60 minutes. Probably worth enabling from the start.

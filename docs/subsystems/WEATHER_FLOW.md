# Weather Flow — Design & Architecture

## Implementation Status

**Tier 1 — NWS (Live)**

Two separate Node-RED flows, both built and publishing:

- **`Utility: Weather Forecasts`** — Resolves NWS grid coordinates on startup and daily at 23:55 (cronplus), storing the forecast URL in flow context. Fetches normalized 7-day forecast hourly and on startup. Publishes `highland/state/weather/forecast` with a date-keyed period map including NWS condition codes, temperature, precip chance, and wind.
- **`Utility: Weather Alerts`** — Polls NWS active alerts endpoint every 30 seconds. Tracks alert lifecycle (new/updated/expired) in flow context. Publishes `highland/state/weather/alerts` retained snapshot and fires three lifecycle event topics.

**Primary consumer:** Both Tier 1 flows feed the `Utility: Daily Digest` — the forecast and any active alerts are included in the nightly digest email sent to household residents.

**Tier 2 — Weather Analysis (Partial — Live)**

`Utility: Weather Analysis` is live and polling PirateWeather every 5 minutes (rate-limitable to 1 minute). It provides:
- Minutely precipitation threat analysis with AccuWeather-style messaging
- Persistent HA Companion notifications for imminent precipitation events
- Tempest cross-validation (PirateWeather forecast vs. ground truth)
- `highland/state/weather/analysis` retained state topic

Remaining Tier 2 work: threshold calibration from observed weather events, removal of the rate limiter in favor of 1-minute continuous polling once committed to the PirateWeather paid plan, and `Utility: Weather Lightning` for hyperlocal lightning notifications.

The full synthesis layer (`highland/state/weather/conditions`) combining Tempest observations with PirateWeather data into a unified conditions snapshot is deferred until a concrete consumer need emerges (likely a cohesive HA weather dashboard).

## Overview

Node-RED utility flow providing weather awareness, precipitation sensing, and actionable notifications. Designed around a polling state machine that scales API call frequency to actual weather threat level, keeping costs predictable while maintaining responsiveness during active events.

---

## Data Sources

The Weather flow is a **black box synthesizer**. Multiple ingestion paths feed a single authoritative output. Source attribution never appears in published topics — the rest of the system sees one curated weather service.

### WeatherFlow Tempest Station

Local physical station publishing real-time observations via MQTT to the bus.

**Data provided:** Temperature, humidity, dew point, pressure, wind speed/gust/bearing, UV index, solar radiation, lightning strike distance and energy (hardware detection), local precipitation (optical sensor).

**Role:** Observations are ground truth for current conditions. Tempest data takes priority over model data for present-moment values. Lightning events come exclusively from Tempest hardware detection.

### Pirate Weather API

**Selected over Weatherbit:** ~$5/month vs $45/month; strong HRRR model sourcing for near-term minutely precision.

**Base URL:** `https://api.pirateweather.net/forecast/[apikey]/[lat],[lon]`

**Standard parameters — always include:** `?units=us&version=2`
- `units=us` — Fahrenheit, inches, mph. Confirmed from live response.
- `version=2` — Unlocks type-specific precipitation fields (`rainIntensity`, `snowIntensity`, `iceIntensity`), accumulation fields, `cape`, and ensemble spread (`precipIntensityError`). Always include; no reason not to.

**Credentials:** `config.secrets.weather_api_key`

### Location Context

Coordinates stored in `secrets.json` (lat/lon are private). Nearest API city: Gardnertown — confirms coordinate-based grid lookup, not population-center snap.

**Microclimate note:** Hudson Valley terrain creates significant hyperlocal variation. Forecasts snapped to "Newburgh" would often be wrong for this location. The HRRR grid cell resolves to approximately 1.5 mi offset.

---

## Known API Quirks

**`-999` sentinel value:** Several fields return `-999` when data is unavailable rather than null. Must null-guard in processing. Confirmed fields: `smoke`, `fireIndex` (only available for ~first 36 hours), `smokeMax`, `fireIndexMax` in daily.

**`sleetIntensity` in minutely:** Present in live response but undocumented. Treat as bonus data, not guaranteed.

**Rate limit headers:** `Ratelimit-Limit`, `Ratelimit-Remaining`, `Ratelimit-Reset`, `X-Forecast-API-Calls`. Log `X-Forecast-API-Calls` on every response. Alert at >50% quota before 50% through month; alert at >80% before 80% through month.

---

## Polling State Machine

The core cost-control mechanism. Polling frequency scales with weather threat level.

| State | Poll Interval | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `POLL_DORMANT` | 15 min | No precipitation expected; baseline monitoring |
| `POLL_MONITOR` | 5 min | Precipitation possible within forecast window |
| `POLL_ACTIVE` | 1 min | Precipitation imminent or occurring; full resolution |
| `POLL_LIGHTNING` | 1 min | Thunderstorm active |

### State Transitions

**DORMANT → MONITOR:** Any hourly block within next 6 hours: `precipProbability > 0.40`

**MONITOR → ACTIVE:** Any minutely block: `precipIntensity > 0.01 in/hr` AND `precipProbability > 0.70`, OR any hourly within next 2 hours: `precipProbability > 0.80`

**ACTIVE → MONITOR:** All minutely blocks below `0.005 in/hr` for 30 consecutive minutes AND no hourly within next 2 hours exceeds `0.70`

**MONITOR → DORMANT:** All hourly within next 6 hours below `0.25`; hold minimum 15 min in MONITOR before allowing transition

**Any → LIGHTNING:** `cape > 2500 J/kg` in current or next 2 hourly blocks AND `precipProbability > 0.50`

**LIGHTNING → ACTIVE:** `cape < 500 J/kg` sustained for 2 consecutive polls AND no lightning detection

### `precipIntensityError` as Confidence Gate

`precipIntensityError` is the standard deviation of `precipIntensity` across GEFS/ECMWF ensemble members. If `precipIntensityError > precipIntensity * 0.75`, treat the forecast as lower confidence and require higher `precipProbability` to trigger escalation.

### `exclude` Parameter Strategy

| State | `exclude` parameter |
|-------|---------------------|
| `POLL_DORMANT` | `minutely,alerts` |
| `POLL_MONITOR` | `alerts` |
| `POLL_ACTIVE` | *(none)* |
| `POLL_LIGHTNING` | *(none)* |

---

## Precipitation State Machine

Tracks the current precipitation event lifecycle. Separate from polling state.

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `PRECIP_NONE` | No precipitation |
| `PRECIP_IMMINENT` | High probability within 30 minutes per minutely |
| `PRECIP_ACTIVE` | Currently precipitating |
| `PRECIP_TAPERING` | Intensity declining; event may be ending |
| `PRECIP_DONE` | Event ended; cooling-off before returning to NONE |

### Precipitation Type Tracking

Uses v2 type-specific intensity fields: `rainIntensity`, `snowIntensity`, `iceIntensity`, `currentDaySnow`, `currentDayLiquid`, `currentDayIce`.

**Derived `precipitation_type` enum:** `rain` | `snow` | `ice` | `sleet` | `mixed` | `none`

---

## NWS Forecast — Icon Code Reference

NWS condition codes are extracted from the NWS icon URL path. Priority hierarchy resolves compound URLs — precipitation/severe codes take precedence over cloud cover codes.

| NWS Code | Condition | Meteocons Day | Meteocons Night |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| `skc` | Clear | `clear-day` | `clear-night` |
| `few` | Few clouds | `partly-cloudy-day` | `partly-cloudy-night` |
| `sct` | Scattered clouds | `partly-cloudy-day` | `partly-cloudy-night` |
| `bkn` | Broken clouds | `overcast-day` | `overcast-night` |
| `ovc` | Overcast | `overcast` | `overcast` |
| `rain` | Rain | `rain` | `rain` |
| `rain_showers` | Rain showers | `partly-cloudy-day-rain` | `partly-cloudy-night-rain` |
| `snow` | Snow | `snow` | `snow` |
| `snow_showers` | Snow showers | `partly-cloudy-day-snow` | `partly-cloudy-night-snow` |
| `tsra` | Thunderstorm | `thunderstorms-day` | `thunderstorms-night` |
| `tsra_sct` | Scattered thunderstorms | `thunderstorms-day-rain` | `thunderstorms-night-rain` |
| `fzra` | Freezing rain | `sleet` | `sleet` |
| `wind_few` | Windy, few clouds | `wind` | `wind` |
| `fog` | Fog | `fog-day` | `fog-night` |
| `blizzard` | Blizzard | `snow` | `snow` |

---

## Configuration

All weather configuration lives in `weather.json`, loaded into `global.config.weather` by the Config Loader. This includes radar loop profiles, layer definitions, and Tier 2 polling thresholds. See `config/weather.json` in the repo for the current schema.

Tier 2 threshold values are initial estimates — calibrate against observed events.

---

## Weather Analysis

### Architecture

`Utility: Weather Analysis` polls the PirateWeather API for minutely forecast data, analyzes the 61-minute window for precipitation threats, cross-validates against Tempest ground truth, publishes a state topic, and manages persistent HA Companion notifications.

**Data source:** PirateWeather API v2 (`https://api.pirateweather.net/forecast/{key}/{lat},{lon}?units=us&version=2`). Full payload fetched on every cycle — no `exclude` parameter.

**Cadence:** CronPlus fires every minute; a rate limiter gate allows through every N ticks (`gate_tick` flow variable, default 5 = 5-minute effective cadence). Set `gate_tick = 1` for 1-minute cadence during active weather.

**Tempest cross-validation:** The flow subscribes to `highland/state/weather/station` and tracks `precipitation_type` in flow context. `Build Message` uses this to determine dry vs. active state, driving different message framing for the same PirateWeather analysis result.

### Flow Design

`Utility: Weather Analysis` groups:

| Group | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Analysis Pipeline** | Entry point: Begin Analysis Cycle link in → link calls to Forecast Acquisition, Forecast Analysis, MinuteCast Notifications |
| **Forecast Acquisition** | link in → Build Request → Fetch Forecast → Extract Data → return link |
| **Forecast Analysis** | link in → Analyze Minutely → Build Message → Publish State → return link |
| **MinuteCast Notifications** | link in → Manage Notification → MQTT Out → return link |
| **Local Observations** | MQTT In (`highland/state/weather/station`) → Extract Station Data (flow context only, no output) |
| **Sinks** | CronPlus Poll → Rate Limiter → link out to Begin Analysis Cycle |
| **Test Cases** | Manual cadence controls + Force Threat + Force Clear synthetic data injectors |
| **Error Handling** | Catch All → debug |

### Minutely Analysis

`Analyze Minutely` scans the 61-minute array and produces precipitation windows — contiguous blocks of active minutes. A minute is considered active when both `precip_probability >= 0.60` AND `precip_intensity >= 0.02 in/hr`.

**Provisional thresholds (calibrate from observed events):**

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Trigger probability | ≥ 0.60 | Create/maintain notification |
| Clear probability | < 0.30 | Hysteresis — clear notification |
| Minimum intensity | ≥ 0.02 in/hr | Ignore trace amounts |
| Heavy rain | > 0.30 in/hr | Prefix "Heavy" |
| Heavy snow | > 0.10 in/hr | ~1–2 in/hr snow equivalent |
| Thunderstorm CAPE | > 500 J/kg | Replace type label with thunder variant |

### Message Generation

`Build Message` generates AccuWeather-style strings based on Tempest dry/active state and the analysis window:

**Dry state (Tempest confirms nothing active):**
- `"Rain starting in 10 minutes"` — single window, clean onset
- `"Periods of rain starting in 10 minutes"` — multiple windows (intermittent)
- `"Rain starting shortly"` — onset at minute 0

**Active state (Tempest confirms precipitation):**
- `"Rain continuing for at least 60 minutes"` — extends to end of window
- `"Rain stopping in 7 minutes"` — clears within window
- `"Periods of rain for the next 23 minutes"` — intermittent, then clears

**Type labels:** `rain` | `snow` | `sleet` | `rain and snow` | `rain and sleet` | `snow and sleet` | `rain, snow, and sleet`. Thunder modifier replaces primary type: `thunderstorms` | `thundersnow` | `thundersleet`. Heavy modifier prefixes single-type rain or snow.

### Notification Lifecycle

`Manage Notification` maintains a single persistent notification per household with `correlation_id: weather_precip_forecast`. Hysteresis via `flow.notification_active` prevents flicker at threshold boundaries:

- **Threat emerges** — publish to `highland/event/notify` with `notification_id: weather.precip_forecast`, `sticky: true`, radar loop image, `clickAction` tap to weather dashboard
- **Threat persists** — re-publish same `correlation_id` (HA replaces in-place)
- **Threat clears** — publish to `highland/command/notify/clear`; only fires once (hysteresis)

Notification subscription in `notifications.json`:
```json
"weather.precip_forecast": {
  "targets": ["people.joseph.ha_companion"],
  "severity": "low"
}
```

### MQTT Topics

See `standards/MQTT_TOPICS.md` — Weather Analysis section for full payload schema.

- `highland/state/weather/analysis` — retained, full threat analysis on every cycle

---

## Weather Station

### Architecture

WeatherFlow Tempest station broadcasts UDP packets on port 50222 to the LAN. A lightweight `socat` relay running as a systemd service (`highland-tempest-relay`) on the Workflow host receives the broadcast and unicasts to port 50223, where Node-RED's Docker container can receive it. Docker bridge networking does not forward broadcast traffic to containers, making the relay necessary.

`Utility: Weather Station` is the sole consumer of the UDP stream. It decodes and dispatches all Tempest message types, normalizes observations to US customary units, and publishes to the MQTT bus.

### Message Types

| Type | Cadence | Handling |
|------|---------|----------|
| `obs_st` | Every 1 minute | Normalize → state + observation event |
| `evt_precip` | On rain onset | Publish precipitation start event |
| `evt_strike` | On lightning | Publish lightning event |
| `rapid_wind` | Every 3 seconds | Plumbing in place, not yet processed |
| `hub_status` | Every 10 seconds | Dropped (not yet handled) |
| `device_status` | Every minute | Dropped (not yet handled) |

### Flow Design

`Utility: Weather Station` groups:

| Group | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Event Sinks** | UDP In → Decode Buffer → Build Target → Dispatch (dynamic link call) |
| **Tempest Events** | Link-in handlers for each message type: Observation, Precipitation Start, Lightning Strike, Rapid Wind |
| **Home Assistant Discovery** | On Startup → Build Sensors → MQTT Out (14 sensor configs, retained) |
| **Error Handling** | Catch All → debug |

The `Build Target` function sets `msg.target` to the link-in node name for each message type. The dynamic link call dispatches to the correct handler. Each handler normalizes its payload and returns via a return-mode link out.

### Unit Conversions

| Measurement | Raw Unit | Published Unit | Formula |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Temperature | °C | °F | `(C × 9/5) + 32` |
| Wind speed | m/s | mph | `× 2.23694` |
| Pressure | mbar | inHg | `× 0.02953` |
| Rain | mm | inches | `× 0.0393701` |
| Lightning distance | km | miles | `× 0.621371` |

### MQTT Topics

See `standards/MQTT_TOPICS.md` — Weather Station section for full payload schemas.

- `highland/state/weather/station` — retained, full normalized observation
- `highland/event/weather/station/observation` — not retained, fires each minute
- `highland/event/weather/station/precipitation_start` — not retained, optical sensor trigger
- `highland/event/weather/station/lightning` — not retained, per-strike event

### Infrastructure

**Relay service:** `workflow/systemd/highland-tempest-relay.service`

```
socat UDP-RECV:50222,reuseaddr UDP-SENDTO:127.0.0.1:50223
```

**Docker port mapping** in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "1880:1880"
  - "50223:50223/udp"
```

## Radar Pipeline

### Architecture

Base reflectivity radar is implemented as a **standalone Python daemon on the hub** — entirely outside Node-RED and Docker. The daemon owns scheduling, fetching, compositing, and delivery. Node-RED's role is limited to:

- Pushing configuration to the daemon via MQTT on startup and on demand
- Subscribing to rendered/error/status events for logging and automation
- Enabling or disabling individual products via MQTT

This architecture eliminates the fragility of long-running exec nodes — Node-RED deploys no longer interrupt the radar pipeline.

### Components

└── logs/weather.log           — JSONL log
```

### Systemd Services

Two services run on the hub as `hub-daemon`:

- **`highland-weather-daemon`** — wakes every 60 seconds, checks each enabled product's cadence, spawns product scripts in the background
- **`highland-weather-config-listener`** — persistent MQTT subscriber, writes config to disk on receipt

### Per-Product Pipeline (Reflectivity)

1. Fetch RainViewer API frame list
2. Short-circuit if frame hashes unchanged since last run
3. Evict stale cache entries
4. Fetch and composite any uncached frames (radar tiles over base map)
5. Apply static overlay + per-frame timestamp to all frames
6. Generate interpolated blend frames between consecutive real frames
7. Assemble animated GIF with per-frame delays
8. SFTP deliver to HAOS `/config/www/hub.local/weather/radar/`
9. Publish MQTT events

### Frame Caching

RainViewer frame paths are hash-based and immutable — content at a given hash never changes. The pipeline caches:

- **Real frames:** `/assets/cache/{hash}.png` — composited radar+basemap, cached indefinitely until hash leaves the active frame list
- **Interpolated frames:** `/assets/cache/interp_{hash_a}_{hash_b}_{n}.png` — morph blends between adjacent overlaid frames, cached until either parent hash is evicted

With 1-minute cadence and hash-based short-circuit, most runs cost only one RainViewer API call.

### HAOS Delivery

Completed GIFs are delivered via SFTP to `/config/www/hub.local/weather/radar/` on HAOS. Files are served at:

```
http://home.local:8123/local/hub.local/weather/radar/reflectivity.gif
```

This URL works both inside and outside the local network (via Nabu Casa or reverse proxy).

### Node-RED Flow — `Utility: Weather Radar`

The flow contains four groups:

| Group | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Sinks** | On Startup → Latch → Build Configuration → MQTT Out (retained config push) |
| **Product Control** | Enable/Disable inject nodes → MQTT Out per product |
| **Event Listeners** | MQTT In nodes for rendered/error/status/last_updated |
| **Test Cases** | Manual inject for forcing config re-push |

All exec nodes, HTTP request nodes, and script invocation are removed. The flow is purely MQTT publish/subscribe.

### Configuration Flow

`Build Configuration` assembles the daemon config from Node-RED's global config (`config.location`, `config.secrets`, `config.weather`) and publishes it as a retained JSON message to `highland/command/weather/config`. The config listener on the hub receives it and writes `/var/lib/highland/weather/config/weather.json`. The daemon reads this file fresh on every tick.

## Notifications

| Trigger | Severity | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Rain event starting | `low` | During waking hours only unless heavy |
| Heavy rain (>0.3 in/hr) | `medium` | Any time |
| Snow event starting | `medium` | Always |
| Significant snow accumulation (>2") | `high` | Sensor-based |
| Ice/freezing rain detected | `high` | Type-specific field trigger |
| Thunderstorm imminent | `high` | CAPE threshold + precip |
| Severe weather alert | `high` or `critical` | From alerts block |
| Event ended after significant accumulation | `low` | Summary notification |

---

## MQTT Topics

See `standards/MQTT_TOPICS.md` for authoritative payload definitions.

**State (retained):** `highland/state/weather/conditions` | `forecast` | `alerts` | `precipitation`

> **Note:** `highland/state/weather/alerts` is published by `Utility: Weather Alerts` (Tier 1, live). The remaining state topics are Tier 2 targets.

**Events (not retained):** `highland/event/weather/precipitation_start` | `precipitation_end` | `precipitation_type_change` | `lightning_detected` | `wind_gust` | `alert/new` | `alert/updated` | `alert/expired`

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] Ultrasonic snow depth sensor hardware selection and mounting
- [ ] Optimal `precipIntensityError` confidence gate threshold — calibrate from observed events
- [ ] Whether `nearestStormDistance` / `nearestStormBearing` useful for lightning threat lead time
- [ ] Stadia Maps plan upgrade required before go-live — see Licensing section below

---

## Implementation Notes

- All `-999` values must be null-guarded before use in logic or display
- `sleetIntensity` in minutely: use if present, don't depend on it
- State machines persist state in flow context (disk-backed) to survive restarts
- HRRR subhourly source freshness: check `flags.sourceTimes.hrrr_subh` to confirm data recency

---

## Licensing — Stadia Maps

**Current status:** Free tier (development only)

The radar base map pipeline fetches 25 raster tiles and assembles them server-side. This constitutes bulk downloading and server-side caching, which is **prohibited on the Stadia Maps free tier** except via their dedicated `static_cacheable` endpoint.

The free tier is acceptable during development. Before go-live, upgrade to the **Starter plan ($20/month)**, which grants rights to cache and store map images digitally for as long as the subscription is active.

**Base map refresh cadence at go-live:** Weekly rebuild (daemon checks age on each tick), plus manual force-rebuild by deleting `base_map.png`. At 25 tile fetches per rebuild, this is negligible against the Starter credit allowance.

**Alternative worth evaluating:** The Stadia Maps `static_cacheable` endpoint returns a pre-rendered map image in a single API call rather than requiring tile assembly. This would simplify the pipeline further, though with less control over exact output dimensions and crop. Evaluate when upgrading.
